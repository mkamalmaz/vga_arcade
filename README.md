1TE663 project

One Arduino controls the VGA output, controls the slave Arduino to play music/sfx, reads Wii-controller and handles the game logic.

The code produces 2-bit color output, and in this project we have used the following colors:
           R G+B
00: Black  0 0 0
01: Cyan   0 1 1
10: Red    1 0 0
11: White  1 1 1
